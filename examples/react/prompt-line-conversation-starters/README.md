# Prompt line / Conversation starters

`ChatCustomElement` configured with `input.expanded` layout and `input.starters` so conversation-starter prompts appear immediately when the editor is focused and empty — no typing required. A `renderCustomList` wraps `CDSAIChatAutocomplete` to add a "Prompt suggestions" header above the list.

## What this example shows

- Using `input.expanded: true` so the editor occupies its own full-width row and the action buttons render inline beneath it.
- Configuring `input.starters` so the suggestion list appears immediately when the editor is focused and empty — no typing required. Selecting a starter sends it straight to the chat, skipping the editor.
- Using `starters.renderCustomList` to render `CDSAIChatAutocomplete` with a `headerConfig`, adding a "Prompt suggestions" title above the list. Selecting a starter fires `cds-aichat-autocomplete-send` directly to chat (the default click-to-send behavior of the autocomplete component).
- Using `starters.isOn` to toggle the starters list on and off without removing the config — keeping the rich editor alive so re-enabling is instant.
- Configuring a single `input.actions` toggle button (Chat icon) that enables or disables the starters list. The action is disabled while the input has text because starters only trigger on an empty editor.
- Listening to the `cds-aichat-prompt-change` event on a container ref to track whether the editor has any text.

## When to use this pattern

- You want conversation starters to appear in the prompt line immediately on focus, before the user types anything.
- Your chat surface uses the expanded layout (editor on its own row, actions row beneath).
- You need a labeled starter dropdown (e.g. "Prompt suggestions", "Recent queries") with a visible header.
- You want selecting a starter to send immediately rather than just inserting text into the editor.

## APIs and props demonstrated

| Symbol | Package / kind | Role in this example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ChatCustomElement` | `@carbon/ai-chat` component | Mounts the chat UI at the fullscreen baseline. |
| `PublicConfig` | `@carbon/ai-chat` type | Types the config object passed to `ChatCustomElement`. |
| `StartersConfig` | `@carbon/ai-chat` type | Shape of the `input.starters` object (items + renderCustomList + isOn). |
| `CustomListProps` | `@carbon/ai-chat` type | Props received by the `renderCustomList` callback. |
| `input.expanded` | config prop | Switches the prompt line to the expanded (two-row) layout. |
| `input.starters` | config prop | Shows the starter list on empty-editor focus; auto-sends on selection. |
| `starters.items` | config prop | Static list of conversation-starter prompts. |
| `starters.renderCustomList` | config prop | Replaces the built-in list UI with one that includes a "Prompt suggestions" header. |
| `starters.isOn` | config prop | Toggles the starters list on/off without removing the config. |
| `input.actions` | config prop | Single toggle action that enables or disables the starters list. |
| `CDSAIChatAutocomplete` | `@carbon/ai-chat-components` component | Renders the starter dropdown with `headerConfig`. |
| `layout.showFrame` | config prop | Hides the default frame so the chat fills the host. |
| `openChatByDefault` | config prop | Mounts straight into the conversation, no launcher. |
| `messaging.customSendMessage` | config prop | Mock backend echoing the user's message. |
| `cds-aichat-prompt-change` | event | Fires when the editor content changes; used to disable the toggle when not empty. |

## Run it

**Prerequisite — build the core packages first.** Examples consume the built output of `@carbon/ai-chat-components` and `@carbon/ai-chat`; without this step the dev server will fail with missing-module errors. Rebuild whenever you change anything under `packages/`.

From the repository root:

```bash
npm install
npm run build --workspace=@carbon/ai-chat-components
npm run build --workspace=@carbon/ai-chat

npm run start --workspace=@carbon/ai-chat-examples-react-prompt-line-conversation-starters
```

See [../README.md](../README.md) for the full setup walkthrough.
