# Prompt line / File upload

`ChatCustomElement` with file attachments enabled, using a mock `onFileUpload` handler that simulates a server upload and echoes back file metadata.

## What this example shows

- Enabling attachments with `upload.isOn: true` and providing an `onFileUpload` handler.
- Simulating a 1-second upload with `AbortSignal` support and returning an `ExternalFileReference` wrapped in `StructuredData`.
- The chat rendering each uploaded file as a chip in the user's own message bubble, from the `name` and `mime_type` on the returned reference.
- Echoing attached file metadata back as a text message via `instance.messaging.addMessage` and `MessageResponseTypes.TEXT`, showing what the server receives.
- Documenting the optional `accept`, `maxFileSizeBytes`, and `maxFiles` config knobs (commented in source).

## When to use this pattern

- You need a reference for wiring file uploads into a Carbon AI Chat React app.
- You want to see how server-assigned file references flow back to the chat as `StructuredData`.
- You want the attachment to stay visible in the transcript after it is sent; see the `history-file-attachments` example for keeping it across a reload.

## APIs and props demonstrated

| Symbol | Package / kind | Role in this example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ChatCustomElement` | `@carbon/ai-chat` component | Mounts the chat UI. |
| `PublicConfig` | `@carbon/ai-chat` type | Types the config. |
| `ExternalFileReference` | `@carbon/ai-chat` type | Server-assigned file reference returned by the mock upload. |
| `StructuredData` | `@carbon/ai-chat` type | Wraps the file reference returned from `onFileUpload`. |
| `StructuredField` | `@carbon/ai-chat` type | Typed entry inside `StructuredData.fields`. |
| `MessageRequest` | `@carbon/ai-chat` type | Inspected for `structured_data` to echo files. |
| `ChatInstance` | `@carbon/ai-chat` type | Used by the mock server response helper. |
| `MessageResponseTypes` | `@carbon/ai-chat` enum | `TEXT` used to echo file metadata. |
| `upload.isOn` | config prop | Enables attachments. |
| `upload.onFileUpload` | config prop | Mock upload handler returning `StructuredData`. |
| `upload.accept` (documented) | config prop | Optional MIME/extension allowlist. |
| `upload.maxFileSizeBytes` (documented) | config prop | Optional per-file size cap. |
| `upload.maxFiles` (documented) | config prop | Optional per-message file count cap. |
| `messaging.customSendMessage` | config prop | Mock backend; forwards file messages to the echo helper. |
| `instance.messaging.addMessage` | instance method | Injects the echoed text response. |

## Run it

**Prerequisite — build the core packages first.** Examples consume the built output of `@carbon/ai-chat-components` and `@carbon/ai-chat`; without this step the dev server will fail with missing-module errors. Rebuild whenever you change anything under `packages/`.

From the repository root:

```bash
npm install
npm run build --workspace=@carbon/ai-chat-components
npm run build --workspace=@carbon/ai-chat

npm run start --workspace=@carbon/ai-chat-examples-react-prompt-line-file-upload
```

See [../README.md](../README.md) for the full setup walkthrough.
