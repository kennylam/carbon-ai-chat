# Frameworks / Vite

Vite-powered React example that mounts `ChatContainer` with a minimal mock backend and adds a Vitest + happy-dom test suite.

## What this example shows

- Mounting `ChatContainer` from a Vite dev server with React 19.
- A minimal mock `customSendMessage` that echoes user input.
- Running the same app under Vitest with a happy-dom environment (`vitest.setup.ts`, `src/__tests__`).

## When to use this pattern

- You want an example that also exercises Vitest for your component tests.

## APIs and props demonstrated

| Symbol | Package / kind | Role in this example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ChatContainer` | `@carbon/ai-chat` component | Mounts the chat UI. |
| `PublicConfig` | `@carbon/ai-chat` type | Config shape. |
| `customSendMessage` | `messaging` prop | Minimal echo mock backend. |

## Run it

**Prerequisite — build the core packages first.** Examples consume the built output of `@carbon/ai-chat-components` and `@carbon/ai-chat`; without this step the dev server will fail with missing-module errors. Rebuild whenever you change anything under `packages/`.

From the repository root:

```bash
npm install
npm run build --workspace=@carbon/ai-chat-components
npm run build --workspace=@carbon/ai-chat

npm run dev --workspace=@carbon/ai-chat-examples-react-frameworks-vite
```

(Use `npm run test --workspace=@carbon/ai-chat-examples-react-frameworks-vite` for the Vitest suite, or `test:watch` for watch mode. `build` and `preview` are also available.)

See [../README.md](../README.md) for the full setup walkthrough.
