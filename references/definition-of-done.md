# definition-of-done.md — gates before shipping

Load this to pick the minimum verification gate for what you changed, before marking a task done or opening a PR.

`npm run ci-check` does **not** run `build`, and workspace deps resolve through built artifacts (`es/`, `dist/es/`) rather than TS sources. **Always run `build` BEFORE `ci-check`** — running them the other way around (or running `ci-check` on its own after edits) makes tests resolve consumer imports against a stale `es/`, which surfaces as confusing "no exported member 'X'" errors even though the source clearly exports X.

> **Before running any `build` row below, ask the user whether `npm run aiChat:start` is already running** — a parallel build races the watcher (see [commands.md](commands.md) and the Always-on rules in the root [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md)). This applies to the `build` gates here, not to `ci-check`/`test`/`lint`, which write no artifacts.

## Minimum gate by area edited

| Area edited | Minimum gate before shipping |
| --- | --- |
| Cross-cutting / multiple packages | `npm run build && npm run ci-check` |
| `packages/ai-chat/` | `npm run build --workspace=@carbon/ai-chat` + `npm run test --workspace=@carbon/ai-chat` |
| `packages/ai-chat-components/` | `npm run build --workspace=@carbon/ai-chat-components` + `npm run test --workspace=@carbon/ai-chat-components` (runs web-components + react suites) |
| `demo/` | `npm run build --workspace=@carbon/ai-chat-examples-demo` + `npm run test --workspace=@carbon/ai-chat-examples-demo` (Playwright) |
| `examples/**` | `npm run build --workspace=<example>` + visual smoke via `npm run start --workspace=<example>` (load in browser, open chat, send one message, confirm no console errors) |
| SCSS only | `npm run lint:styles && npm run format` |

Always run `npm run lint` + `npm run lint:license` before opening a PR if you touched more than one file — husky's pre-commit only runs prettier/eslint/stylelint on staged files and does not check license headers.

Report a gate by showing it: the command you ran and what its output said. "Tests pass" is a claim about the gate, not the gate — and a gate that goes green because an assertion was loosened, a case was deleted, a case was skipped, or a snapshot was regenerated to match current output is not the gate passing either. If you had to change a proof to get green, say which one and why; that is a finding, not a step.

Before declaring a task done, self-review the diff against this repo's review rubric — the `caic-review` skill carries it. Prefer a sub-agent for independence and to keep the main conversation lean. Act on **Blocker** findings before handing back; surface **Important** findings to the user.
