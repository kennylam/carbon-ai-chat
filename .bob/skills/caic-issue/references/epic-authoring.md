# epic-authoring.md — authoring and running epics

When to group work under an umbrella epic, how to structure one, and how to track its children.

Load this when the user asks to "open an epic" or "plan out a big effort", when deciding whether a chunk of work is one issue or many, or when a plan's per-step breakdown needs projecting onto GitHub. Sub-issue mechanics live in the parent [caic-issue](../SKILL.md) skill.

## Epic vs. plain issue

An epic must pass a **two-part test** — it is _both_:

1. **Too big for one issue** — the work splits into multiple child issues, often interdependent or sequenced.
2. **Bounded and finishable** — it has a fixed scope and a describable done-state, so it can be closed.

Fail either test and it is **not** an epic:

- Fits in one PR → a plain issue.
- Open-ended feature area that never completes ("Prompt line development") → a **label or project**, not an epic. An epic-as-label keeps accreting children, so `percent_completed` is meaningless and the issue never closes. Avoid this shape.

## Structuring an epic

File epics with the [EPIC.yaml](../../../../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/EPIC.yaml) form. The body holds:

- **Value proposition** — why we're doing this, framed from the user/stakeholder's side.
- **Expected outcomes** — the done-state as a `- [ ]` list: the observable results that let this epic close. When a plan produced the epic, these are its Done when items carried over, not rewritten — see [caic-plan](../../caic-plan/SKILL.md#the-spine). For internal engineering work these are engineering outcomes, not KPIs, whatever the form's prompt suggests. Every child's acceptance criteria trace back to one of them.
- **Decisions** — the ADRs governing this epic, one line each. Optional, and empty for most epics. An epic states _what work_; an ADR states _why this shape_. When the epic asserts a choice a consumer can feel — an API removed, a default reversed, a behavior dropped — that choice needs a record behind it, or the reasoning exists nowhere and reviewers re-argue it in every child PR. See [caic-adr](../../caic-adr/SKILL.md).
- **Out of scope** — what this epic deliberately excludes. This boundary is what keeps an epic from drifting into a feature-area bucket.
- **Details / child work** — the parent link, plus what the sub-issue list can't show. See below.

If you can't write a crisp "out of scope" and a concrete done-state, the work is probably a label, not an epic — see the test above.

## Writing the Details section

**Never restate the children as a bullet list.** GitHub renders every child with its live title and state; a hand-kept copy is stale the first time one moves, closes, or gets regrouped. Point at the list instead, then spend the section on what the sidebar can't show.

When children group into sub-epics, give the grouping as a table — one row per sub-epic, one column for the surface it owns:

```markdown
Parent epic: #1486. The sub-issue list on this epic is the child record, so it is not restated here.

Children that share a surface get a sub-epic. The rest stay flat.

| Sub-epic | Surface                     |
| -------- | --------------------------- |
| #1930    | The writeable-element enum  |
| #1931    | Event bus and send pipeline |
```

Keep the prose that carries judgment: sequencing, decisions settled so children don't re-litigate them, and known risks. That's the reason the section exists. Blockers between children are dependency links, not prose — see [Recording blockers](../SKILL.md#recording-blockers).

## Adding children

- Sub-issue creation and the database-**id** linking gotcha: see [caic-issue](../SKILL.md).
- A sub-issue may have only **one** parent — a child can't belong to two epics at once.
- Each child should be independently closeable and map to one PR's worth of work.

## Tracking progress

The parent's `sub_issues_summary` reports `total`, `completed`, and `percent_completed`. Read it with:

```bash
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<parent> --jq .sub_issues_summary
```

For the actual child list, paginate:

```bash
gh api --paginate "repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<parent>/sub_issues?per_page=100"
```

The summary count can lag a cached read; when the summary and the paginated list disagree, trust the list.

## Grouping and ordering

- Keep related children together and order them roughly in the sequence they'll be tackled, so the epic reads as a plan.
- Ordering is intent; a hard blocker is a dependency link. Record it with the `blocked_by` API — see [Recording blockers](../SKILL.md#recording-blockers) — and keep the epic body for the reason, not `Blocked by: #N` in place of the link.
- When a child grows its own multi-issue scope, spin it into its **own** epic and link the two — don't nest sub-issues arbitrarily deep or overload one epic past its bounded scope.
