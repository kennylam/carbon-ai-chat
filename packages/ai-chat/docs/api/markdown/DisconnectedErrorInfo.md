This is used to indicate the state of errors that can happen any time during a chat where the service desk
implementation has lost a connection to the back-end. If this error occurs while the user is waiting for an
agent to join, it will be treated as a ErrorType.CONNECTING error instead.

## Signature

```ts
interface DisconnectedErrorInfo
