ObjectMap.

### hasSentNonWelcomeMessage

`hasSentNonWelcomeMessage: boolean`

If the user has received a message beyond the welcome node. We use this to mark if the chat has been interacted
with. This flag is duplicated so the information is available before hydration and before the user is known.
Note that this property reflects only the last user and should only be used when an approximate value is
acceptable.

### showUnreadIndicator

`showUnreadIndicator: boolean`

Indicates if we should show an unread indicator on the launcher. This is set by
ChatInstance.updateAssistantUnreadIndicatorVisibility and will display an empty circle on
the launcher. This setting is overridden if there are any unread human agent messages in which case a circle
with a number is displayed.

### version

`version: string`

The version of the Carbon AI Chat that this data is persisted for. If there are any breaking changes to the
application state and a user reloads and gets a new version of the widget, bad things might happen so we'll
just invalidate the persisted storage if we ever attempt to load an old version on Carbon AI Chat startup.

### viewState
