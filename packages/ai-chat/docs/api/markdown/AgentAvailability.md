# AgentAvailability

- Kind: Interface
- Category: Service desk
- Reference: https://chat.carbondesignsystem.com/version/v1.19.0/docs/interfaces/Type_reference.AgentAvailability.html

Information about the current availability of an agent while a user is waiting to be connected. If these are not set
the Carbon AI Chat will provide generic messaging letting the user know that a request for an agent has been sent.

Note that only one of these fields will be used by Carbon AI Chat if more than one has been assigned a value. Priority
first goes to estimatedWaitTime, then positionInQueue, and then message.
