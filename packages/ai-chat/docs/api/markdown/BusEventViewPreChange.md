- Category: Events
- Reference: https://chat.carbondesignsystem.com/version/v1.19.0/docs/interfaces/Type_reference.BusEventViewPreChange.html

Fires before the view state is updated in the store. This event is awaited, making it ideal for async operations like animations.

**Event Timing:**
1. VIEW_PRE_CHANGE fires (awaited)
2. View state is updated in store
3. VIEW_CHANGE fires (awaited)

**Use cases:**
- Run animations before the view changes
- Modify the new view state before it's applied
- Cancel the view change entirely
