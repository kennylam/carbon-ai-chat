## Members

### customLoadHistory

`customLoadHistory?: (instance: ChatInstance) => Promise<HistoryItem[]>`

This is a callback function that is used by Carbon AI Chat to retrieve history data for populating the Carbon AI Chat. If
this function is defined, it will be used instead of any other mechanism for fetching history.

If this function is mutated after it was initially called, the chat does not re-call it.

### customSendMessage

`customSendMessage?: (request: MessageRequest, requestOptions: CustomSendMessageOptions, instance: ChatInstance) => void | Promise<void>`

A callback for Carbon AI Chat to use to send messages to your assistant.

Carbon AI Chat will queue up any additional user messages until the Promise from a previous call to customSendMessage
has resolved. If you do not make customSendMessage async, it will be up to you to manage what happens when a message is
sent when the previous is still processing. If the Promise rejects, an error indicator will be displayed next to the user's message.

If the request takes longer than PublicConfigMessaging.messageTimeoutSecs than the AbortSignal will be sent.

### messageLoadingIndicatorTimeoutSecs

`messageLoadingIndicatorTimeoutSecs?: number`

Controls how long AI chat should wait before showing the loading indicator. If set to 0, the chat will never show
the loading indicator on its own. This is tied to either ChatInstanceMessaging.addMessage or
ChatInstanceMessaging.addMessageChunk being called after this message was sent. If neither of those methods
are called with in the window defined here, the loading indicator will be shown.

[Reference](https://chat.carbondesignsystem.com/version/v1.19.0/docs/interfaces/Type_reference.PublicConfigMessaging.html#messageloadingindicatortimeoutsecs)

### messageTimeoutSecs

`messageTimeoutSecs?: number`

Changes the timeout used by the message service when making message calls. The timeout is in seconds. The
default is 150 seconds. After this time, an error will be shown in the client and an Abort signal will be sent
to customSendMessage. If set to 0, the chat will never timeout.  This is tied to either ChatInstanceMessaging.addMessage or
ChatInstanceMessaging.addMessageChunk being called after this message was sent. If neither of those methods
are called with in the window defined here, the chat will timeout (unless the value is set to 0).

### showStopButtonImmediately

`showStopButtonImmediately?: boolean`

Controls when the stop streaming button becomes visible during message streaming.

You must have PublicConfigMessaging.customSendMessage return a promise for
this setting to work correctly.

When `true`, the stop button appears immediately when `customSendMessage` is called,
allowing users to cancel requests before the first streaming chunk arrives. This is
useful for slow-starting requests or when you want to give users immediate control
over long-running operations. The button will remain visible as long as there is an
active streaming message, even if the initial message promise resolves.

When `false` (default), the stop button only appears after the first streaming chunk
arrives with `cancellable: true` metadata, maintaining backward compatibility with
existing behavior.

### skipWelcome

`skipWelcome?: boolean`

Indicates if Carbon AI Chat should make a request for the welcome message when a new conversation begins. If this is
true, then Carbon AI Chat will start with an empty conversation.

**Manual session management required**: Changes to this property after conversation has started have no effect.
To apply new welcome behavior, call `instance.messaging.restartConversation()`.
